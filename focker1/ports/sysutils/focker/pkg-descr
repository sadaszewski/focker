Focker is a FreeBSD image orchestration tool in the vein of Docker.
Focker leverages ZFS and Jails to natively provide powerful
containerization primitives (images, volumes and containers) first
introduced by the Docker platform without taking up the
significantly more challenging task of achieving Docker
compatibility. This has never been and never will be the goal of
Focker which allows it to remain a lightweight tool with minimal
dependencies and highly maintainable codebase. At the same time,
the image building paradigm based on checksummed steps/layers and
flexible composition builder offer significant time savings for
pragmatic FreeBSD sysadmins.
